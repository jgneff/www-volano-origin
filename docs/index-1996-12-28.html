<p>Welcome to Volano!
Volano is the home of <a href="chat.html">VolanoChat</a>, the best Web
based chat solution on the Internet today.
Now you can buy VolanoChat with immediate electronic delivery through
<font size="+1"><b><i>software.net</i></b></font>, the Internet software
store!
See the <a href="pricing.html">Pricing Page</a> for more information
about buying VolanoChat.

<p><font size="+1"><b>It's <font color="#800000">Java</font></b></font><br>
Both the VolanoChat Client and Server are written in 100% Java,
giving you more flexibility and your Web visitors less frustration.
Don't limit yourself with browser plug-ins &#150; the VolanoChat Client
has run in
<a href="browsers.html">175 different Java environments</a>!
And the VolanoChat Server can run on
<a href="jvm.html">any system that supports Java</a>.

<p><font size="+1"><b>It's <font color="#008000">international</font></b></font><br>
The VolanoChat Client is available in six languages (English, French,
German, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish), and can be easily translated
into other languages.
All character sets are available through Java's support of the Unicode
Worldwide Character Standard.

<p><font size="+1"><b>It's <font color="#0000C0">manageable</font></b></font><br>
You have complete control over who can connect to the VolanoChat Server
and through which Web pages they can make those connections, using the
same host and referrer access control directives used by popular Web
servers such as NCSA HTTPd and Apache.
You can chat in rooms and monitor them at the same time, with control to
kick out unwanted guests or ban them permanently from the Server.

<p><font size="+1"><b>It's <font color="#800000">standard</font></b></font><br>
The Server records each connection in a log file using the same
format as your Web server, so any standard Web log analysis program can
compile statistics about its usage.
The logging includes connection counts and duration in addition to the
standard access, agent, referrer and error logging.

<p><font size="+1"><b>It's <font color="#008000">private</font></b></font><br>
Users can chat publicly or in private chat rooms. There is no
recording of room names, user names, user profiles or chat text.
Connection statistics are logged with the connection identified by the
user's IP address &#150; no less private than just surfing the Web.

<p><font size="+1"><b>It's <font color="#0000C0">small</font></b></font><br>
The entire Client applet is only 39 kilobytes using Microsoft's Internet
Explorer &#150; less than the size of a single GIF or JPEG image on many
pages.
And it's just 119 kilobytes using Netscape Navigator.

<p><font size="+1"><b>It's <font color="#800000">fast</font></b></font><br>
The Server is completely multithreaded, making efficient use of your
processor and taking full advantage of the new multiprocessor machines
now available.

<p><font size="+1"><b>It's <font color="#008000">powerful</font></b></font><br>
It can handle the hundreds of connections for which other chat
solutions charge thousands of dollars more!

<p><font size="+1"><b>It's <font color="#0000C0">dynamic</font></b></font><br>
You can change all of the Client applet properties on the fly without
having to stop and restart the server.
You can change advertisements daily or omit advertising altogether.
You can even make daily changes for special themes and holiday events.

<p><font size="+1"><b>It's <font color="#800000">affordable</font></b></font><br>
For $295 you can have an unlimited number of Clients connecting to
the Server from your Web pages.
It will pay for itself through the support of in-room advertising, or
you can charge a monthly fee for access to your VolanoChat Server.
With VolanoChat, you can tell your advertisers how many times people
connected and how long they stayed connected, giving them value far
beyond transitory Web hits.

<p><font size="+1"><b>It's <font color="#008000">yours</font></b></font><br>
Everything on the applet you see and hear &#150; all text, images,
sounds, colors, fonts, help pages, buttons, logos, and advertisements
&#150; can be replaced with those representing yourself or your company.
There are more than 125 different settings that you can modify!

<p><font size="+1"><b>It's <font color="#0000C0">now</font></b></font><br>
VolanoChat is available for immediate electronic delivery through
<font size="+1"><b><i>software.net</i></b></font>, the Internet software
store.
